  <description>freqfilter implements a direct form 2 FIR/IIR real or complex tap filter leveraging scipy.signal lfilter.

1.  Component configured via property &quot;a&quot; or &quot;b&quot;.  This provides filtering via the parameters provided regardless of the input sample rate.  Please see scipy documenation for more information on lfilter and iir filter design for help in intelligiently choosing these parameters.

2.  Component configured via &quot;filterProps&quot;.  This clears the properties &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;.  The component proceedes to design a set of filter coeficients acording to the values of &quot;filterProps&quot;.</description>
