  <description>Freq filter implements a direct form 2 FIR/IIR real or complex tap filter leveraging scipy.signal lfilter.

The default properties are configured for a FIR bandpass fiter with stopbands from 0 to .1*FS and .4*FS to .5*FS and a passband from .2*FS to .3*FS.  It was designed with the following python code:

> from scipy.signal import remez
> taps = remez(8,[0,.1,.2,.3,.4,.5],[0,1,0])

Please see scipy for complete documentation.</description>
