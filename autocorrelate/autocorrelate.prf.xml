    <description>NORMAL is the standard autocorrelation layout where the center spike is in the middle of the output frame and you have 2*correlationSize+1 points

ROTATED flips the front and back of the display.  This puts the center spike at index 0 and frame index chorosponds exactly to the delay.  This makes it easy to measure the correlation delay.  There are still 2*correlationSize+1 points per output frame.

SUPERIMPOSED is like ROTATED but the 2nd half of the output frame is flipped and added to the first 1/2.  This means the output frame consists of exactly correlationSize output samples.  Autocorrelation will be approximatly symetric for indicies close to 0 since the correlation output for a dealay of N is approximatly the same as an advance of N for small N.  The superposition adds the correlation output for the delay as well as the advace to get twice the averaging effect. </description>
