  <description>Resamples a data stream at output rates which are not limited to integer multiples of the input sampling rate.  This component can increase or decrease the sample rate.  No anti-aliasing filtering is included, so users must use this component with caution when decreasing the sampling rate to avoid aliasing or pre-filter themselves in an upstream component if required.</description>
